# SpeechifyMe
SpeechifyMe is a web application that transforms text into natural-sounding speech using AWS Polly and Lambda. Users can input text, choose from multiple voice options, and listen to or download the generated speech. The project features a modern, dynamic interface with an animated gradient background and seamless integration with AWS services for reliable and scalable text-to-speech conversion. Hosted on AWS and continuously deployed via GitHub Actions, SpeechifyMe ensures a smooth and up-to-date user experience.
